Why we added some additional element:

1- Firewalls: on this web infrasturcure firewalls can be acting as filters on
   	      the host, to allowes or reject certain IPs or requests going
	      from or to the servers.

2- SSL: adding SSL which stand for Secure Session Layer, will inhanced the
   	data transefer between host and users by using the HTTPS protocol,
	which incripts the data before sending it the internet.

3- monitoring tools: monitoring on web design and development is a critical
   	      	     concepts, monitoring your website or application can aid
		     you to optimize user experaince and host performas,
		     beside prevents any feature threats that could be on
		     the host.

Firewalls: firewalls are a software or hardware that get between the host and
	   the internet which act as filter for the incomming and outgoing
	   data.

Why using HTTPS?
    using HTTPS over HTTP is more secure and trustable by the users, because
    all the transfered data are encripted, and can not be decripted by third
    party.

What monitoring is used for?
    used fir collecting perforamnce data and prevent feature threats, inoredr
    to inhanced and improve users experiance.

How the monitoring tool is collecting data?
    By tracking the host availabilty, performance, and resources utiliazation.
