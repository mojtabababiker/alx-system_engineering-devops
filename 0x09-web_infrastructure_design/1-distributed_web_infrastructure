Why we added some additional element:

    1- server:
       By adding one additional server increases the Availabilty and inhances
       the scalablity, on the planned and un-planned downtime

    2- load-balancer:
       The main role of the load-palancer is to dived the trafic between the
       two server

Load-balancer Algrothim:

    The load-balancer uses the least connections algrothim, in which the
    trafic will be send to the server that have the less number of requests

    The load-balancer in the current infrastructure is enabling an
    Active-Active setup.
    The difference between Active-Active and Active-Passive, in the
    Active-Active setup the load-balancer will divide the traffic
    between all the servers according to its algrothim, and if there is a
    downtime (planned un-planned) happend at a server the load-balancer will
    cut the traffic from that server and route all of it to rest of servers

The database Primary-Replica cluster:
    Database replication is the practice of creating and storing copies of the
    databse, and it have two types Active-Active cluster in wich all the
    cluster will have the read-write permission and the sync will go on all
    sides. and Read-only cluster in wich one database (master/primary) will
    have the Write permission and all the Read queries will be done on the
    (slaves/replicas)  databases, and the sync will go from the primary to
    replicas


The difference between Primary node and Replica node:
    All the Writing queries will be done on the Primary node mean while the
    Replica will have just the Reading permission, also the sync will be from
    the Primary to all Replica nodes.


The current infrastructure suffers from some issues:

    1- SPOF: this infrastructure has a SPOF at the load-balancer, in wich any
       	     failure on it will leads to downtime for the entire system

    2- Security issues: becuase there are no firewalls on it filtering the
       			received requests, the host can be open to all
			users on the internet as long they have its IP.
			And from anther point in which the connections are
			made by the HTTP and it is a plain-text transfer
			protocol, cuases the transfere data to be opened and
			readabel by any middle nodes between the browser and
			the host

    3- No monitoring: monitoring is important to scale and protect the server
       	  	      or the host from any feature breach, or any overloading
		      that may happend. This infrastructure has no monitoring
		      tools.
